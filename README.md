Once there was a boy who wanted Taco Bells.
However, He didn't have the money for Taco Bells.
So instead he brought burritos.
The burrito was pretty good so he got another.
But it fell on the ground and he was sad.




In my opinion I think Taco Bell is a horrible choice of food destination. The fact that it tastes nothing like true, tasty, authentic Mexican food, it pushes me away from eating at Taco Bell when my taste tongues are feeling 'Mexican'.

But then he wasn't feeling so well after eating the burritos.But then he wasn't feeling so well after eating the burritos.
He quickly called 911 but they couldn't arrive in time.
